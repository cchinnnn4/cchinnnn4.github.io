                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Pagtingin (English: The Way We Feel) is a song by Filipino folk-pop band Ben&amp;Ben, composed by lead vocalist Paolo Benjamin Guico. It was released alongside "Araw-Araw" on May 2, 2019. It was used for the film LSS (Last Song Syndrome) released in 2019 under Globe Studios. The music video of the song was directed by Jorel Lising, with appearances from Gabbi Garcia and Khalil Ramos and was released on July 19, 2019. A sequel to the music video, Araw-Araw, was released two months later on September 28, 2019.
<br>The line “Iibig lang kapag handa na, hindi na lang kung trip-trip lang naman..” caught my attention because, for me, you can’t give love to someone if you are not ready to commit. Love is a very serious thing that can’t be played by anyone. Loving when you’re not ready might hurt someone, so before you enter love, make sure you are prepared and ready at the same time.
<br>The music video is considered the most viewed video on the band's YouTube channel with over 21 million views since its release&nbsp;<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Araw-Araw (English: Everyday) is a song by Filipino folk-pop band Ben&amp;Ben, composed by lead vocalists Miguel Benjamin Guico and Paolo Benjamin Guico. It was released alongside "Pagtingin" on May 2, 2019. This song was used as the theme song of the film LSS (Last Song Syndrome) released in 2019 under Globe Studios, to which it went on to win the 2019 Pista ng Pelikulang Pilipino Awards for "Best Original Song.
<br>	“Mahiwaga pipiliin ka sa araw-araw, mahiwaga ang nadarama sa 'yo'y malinaw” this line made an impact to many people. Loving is choosing a person every day and you are sure about your feelings towards him/her. When you fall in love you don’t care what other people say, you just care about the person you’re in love with. Even though you saw her/his flaws and imperfection, you still choose her/him and you still chose to stay beside her/him.
<br>	The music video of the song was directed by Quark Henares as a sequel to the music video of Pagtingin, with appearances from Gabbi Garcia and Khalil Ramos and was released on September 28, 2019&nbsp;<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">A series of “serendipitous events” led to the collaboration behind the music video for Ben&amp;Ben’s “Sa Susunod na Habang Buhay.” The music video, which stars Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla, is a collaboration between the band, its “resident director” Jorel Lising, and spoken word poet and screenwriter Juan Miguel Severo.  In it, the real-life couple are two lovers who are caught in a time loop which resets after one of them dies. One of them, however, retains all the memories of their past relationship – including the painful ones.
<br>	The lyrics says that “Hindi ba pangako mo nu'ng una, tiwala'y iingatan? Baka naman, sa susunod na habang-buhay”, it really felt sad when you feel the lyrics of the song. We all encounter that kind of scenario where your love one left you, the pain will remain even the broken promises. Somehow you are still hoping that all the promises and unfinished business of yours will continue on the next life.
<br>“Sa Susunod na Habang Buhay” came out in February 2020 and was the first single released after the album Limasawa Street in 2019.&nbsp;<br></p>

                        <strong>Leaves</strong></h3>
                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">I chose “Leaves” by Ben&amp;ben because it is about the process of healing and forgiveness in a relationship. The relationship shown in the music video was about a family with a strong bond that was developed in the music video until a huge loss or death of the mother that created a rift between the father and son. I like the part that says, “But in the end, what makes it worth the fight, that no matter what happened we try to make it right,” because we should learn to forgive all the time just like the lyrics “You never really love someone until you learn to forgive” suggests. In the end of the music video, the father and the son, despite difficulty in their relationship, let time to fix and heal their scar until the two are much closer to each other than before.
<br>I think they wrote the song because of a loss in a romantic relationship that left a huge impact and shattered the writer’s heart. Because of that no one was able to help him move on but time. By the time he’s ready to forgive is the time he already moved on. That’s why I think they wrote the song because they wanted to share the lesson they gained, that time heals.&nbsp;<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The last time Filipino sensation Ben&amp;Ben dropped new music, feelings flooded the internet right at the strike of midnight. The same thing happened as the clock struck midnight on Friday, November 1, when the indie-pop-rock band dropped their latest single, "Masyado Pang Maaga." The song was excluded from their first album, Limasawa Street, precisely because it didn't fit with the theme of the album.
<br>	Paolo Guico, who also sings and plays the guitar for the band, said that while songs in Limasawa Street are predominantly hopeful, "Masyado Pang Maaga" "accompanies the listener in frustration." The song is produced by Ben&amp;Ben with Jean-Paul Verona. It was written by the two brothers. 
<br>	When I heard the lyrics “Sa'n nagkamali? Pwede bang bumawi? Teka lang, teka lang, teka lang muna..” it tells a very personal experience and frustration of why people struggle so much to communicate and understand each other these days. Many relationship end up because of lack of communication and understanding with each other. Sometimes because of our anger we became deaf to the explanation and we decline to communicate, we always tend to decide and the next day we regret our decisions.
<br>In a press release, the band said "Masyado Pang Maaga" might just be included in a deluxe version of their first album, Limasawa Street.&nbsp;<br></p>
