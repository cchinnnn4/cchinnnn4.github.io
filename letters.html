</strong><br>
<br>Not everybody has a rare opportunity to meet someone
<br>who has the same likes and dislikes. Yet the striking
<br>love we all deserve to have is to love someone who has
<br>managed to understand the differences.
<br>
<br>I always told you that I was blessed to have someone I
<br>could show in my vague colors and never dread that my
<br>blues and feelings of inadequacy were contagious. I had
<br>always been grateful to have someone who loves me on
<br>days when I was chaotic and unlovable. Someone who
<br>keeps on accepting me on times when I am not at my
<br>best — when I am not having the cluster of words that I
<br>wanted to clarify what I feel. I wanted to let you know
<br>that I am contented that we reached this point where
<br>both of us became too brave to show the real hues of
<br>clouds that we reserved inside us.
<br>
<br>You made me realize what love is.
<br>
<br>You made me realize it's as complicated as I thought it
<br>will be.</p>

<br>The first time I saw you, walking towards McDonalds, I
<br>never realized that you will mean this much to me.
<br>Then everything after that, happened in fast forward
<br>then. I knew you're different. I knew that you're not
<br>like any other. I knew that you're someone who will
<br>halt my entire universe and will just make me the
<br>happiest without even trying so hard.<br>
<br>I realize that your presence and attention were enough
<br>for me to accept the glimpse of the love that I saw in
<br>you. And that's why I trusted my heart to love you, I
<br>trusted myself to fall from the way you showed me your
<br>affection.<br>
<br>You disclosed and you gave me your interests and your
<br>consistencies. That is why I broke down all the defenses
<br>that I built for myself. For you, I broke down all the
<br>walls that I built way too high for the others saving
<br>myself from the wrong faces of love.<br>
<br>Thank you for existing and for rearranging my world.<br>
<br>Thank you for being here with me.</p>

<br>There's you —someone who taught my heart how to
<br>beat with life and excitement.<br>
<br>I told myself that you're the one. I told myself that I
<br>could never find someone like you if I let you go, if I let
<br>the tendencies of us just slip away from my grasp. And
<br>so I risked love for us. And I will never regret anything.
<br>It became one of the best decisions that I am glad that I
<br>made.<br>
<br>And we are happy. You gave me the attention and love
<br>that I never knew I deserved. For that short moment of
<br>pouring affection, I got used to it. I can't find a reason
<br>not to fall deeper with you. Each day, I never needed
<br>anyone. I stood up in my own ground and validated a
<br>love leading me to the person who shows me that I am
<br>worth loving and fighting for. You always remind me
<br>that I am loved and needed.<br>
<br>And so as you know that I will be here when you want
<br>to hold a hand every time you think you are alone.<br>
<br>I am always here telling you that I will always stay by
<br>your side and help you overcome the day while holding
<br>onto my hand.</p>

<br>You made me feel secure about everything that I
<br>realized, it was not just me alone. In an instant, it
<br>became us.<br>
<br>I found someone who gave me real motivation and good
<br>mornings to look up everyday. I knew I was never and
<br>will never be the perfect person. I knew to love me is
<br>somehow tiring knowing that I have off days. I had
<br>errors in my code that are too tiring to understand.
<br><br>There were times when I had too much and times when
<br>I was left empty and wonder why I was so drained.
<br>Sometimes, I am in between. And somehow, you gave
<br>me those arms where I could sulk my tired self with
<br>whose sound of heartbeats are enough to vanish all my
<br>frustrations with.<br>
<br>I found happiness the day I found you.</p>

<br>You always made me feel that I am worthy of

<br>breaking yourself, when you're dealing with your silent
<br>battles. I will always shoo your monsters and
<br>nightmares away.<br>
<br>I will always try my best to mend you and will remind
<br>you that you are loved. I hope there's more to what I
<br>can do for us.<br>
<br>I hope you will never get tired of being loved by me.</p>

<br>Suddenly, it was just you —the one I wanted to see
<br>right from the start and end of my day.<br>
<br>I wanted you to be the first one who'll get to hear the
<br>best news, someone I reserved my heart for, someone I
<br>would run to when it's dark, someone who knew when
<br>it will come. Someone I wanted to share a new book,
<br>someone I wanted to share the foods that I like,
<br>someone I wanted to get lost with while silencing the
<br>world and expressing my nonstop dramas. Someone I
<br>wanted to share both sides of the pages of the poetries
<br>that I wrote. Someone I wanted to share a coffee with
<br>when the rain comes in, someone I wanted to show the
<br>hues and saturations in my moods. Someone that I wish
<br>who could love me more than just the friendship and
<br>surfaces.<br>
<br>And you became that someone.
<br>You became my world.</p>

<br>You had always been my plot twist, the kind of love
<br>that I never knew I needed until I had.<br>
<br>And I guess, my lucky star granted my wish to have
<br>someone who will love me despite the idea that I am far
<br>from perfection. That I am stitched with flaws and
<br>doubts. You made me the happiest and I know words
<br>weren't needed but you will always be someone that I

<br>The stars have witnessed our love. They shine there as
<br>they try to go against the current of darkness. Hence,
<br>they had witnessed the love that blossomed at night.
<br>We had always loved the silence of the world when the
<br>rest was on slumber. I remember you giving me the
<br>same bracelet that you have and tagged along with it
<br>the promise that you will stay with me forever.<br>
<br>I have them, carved in my poor memory to remind me
<br>that everything between us is worth fighting. The stars
<br>have given us their light to guide us.<br>
<br>You gave me new episodes of optimism that I always
<br>crave. You gave me that peace of mind before I sleep
<br>knowing that I am still loved the next day the moment I
<br>wake up. You gave me that ease and perhaps it's the
<br>measurement that my heart is in good hands.<br>
<br>You gave me such fresh air to breathe and I realized
<br>there's more to me to explore which I never did because
<br>I restricted myself from anyone before.</p>

<br>You made me realize a lot of things. You made me
<br>realize that we don't need to try hard just to be happy.<br>
<br>We're there enjoying simple moments while sharing our
<br>favorite foods. The laughter we shared along our
<br>proben and bibingka dates sent us ecstatic happiness as
<br>we're both getting lost while staring at the stars.<br>
<br>There we are —realigning the same stars that fell out
<br>from the sky and stitched each other again knowing we
<br>will always be each other's savior.<br>
<br>We are each other's cure in this sickened world.<br>
<br>That's when I knew my heart searches for the exact

<br>Our love's adventure never ceases to settle on the
<br>surface. With you, I have learned to chase dreams to
<br>turn them into reality. We had the moments shared as
<br>we take ourselves to malls and amusement park,
<br>taunting ourselves to conquer our fears. We went on a
<br>ride-all-you-can.<br>
<br>We were on our highest highs and lowest lows.<br>
<br>We rode Ferris Wheel, got a panoramic view while
<br>holding your hand and felt your lips touched my
<br>forehead. Whispering promises and I love you's. And I
<br>still treasure that teddy bear you gave me that night.<br>
<br>It was one hell of happiness that rests inside my chest.<br>

<br>You are my game changer, the plot twist that I never

<br>replaced my rains with sunshine and new adventures.
<br>And I know that our journey is still in the first corner
<br>and that the world is way too massive and we still have
<br>more to encounter and face. I know, both of us are still
<br>starting, we still have more phone calls to make, more
<br>secrets to share, more laughter to outburst in the
<br>middle of nowhere.<br>
<br>I guess love is always the happiest at the beginning.
<br>There's the weird excitement in the idea of us. Love is
<br>elated at the start since we have so many things to
<br>unfold, things to try for the first time and things to try
<br>to work out until we understood the depths of each
<br>other.<br>
<br>I know, we still have more sunsets to chase, more
<br>chances to uncover and more risks to take. I know both
<br>of us will always be ready for what's coming and that is
<br>the thing that will keep us stronger.<br>
<br>I know we're still at the beginning but I also know that
<br>we could turn weeks into months, months into years,
<br>and years into forever.<br>
<br>We will make it together.<br>Believe me, we will.</p>

<br>There is no easy way to love me. But you had always
<br>been the bravest for trying everything just to make this

<br>toughest stage. You were so brave for loving someone
<br>like me, for spending time with me, for constantly
<br>checking in me. For always being here. You have no

<br>I have someone who wanted to know if I got home safe,

<br>I am completely blessed I got to spend more of my

<br>changed so much of my unwanted attitudes and helped
<br>me get through the day because I could always have

<br>You became my beautiful reality. Where everything

<br>You're the reason why I wanted to be better. Why I
<br>wanted to keep going because I want to be the right
<br>person for you as well, for us.<br>
<br>And thank you for letting me meet you, for letting me
<br>in your life and giving me a palpable place. You
<br>reserved me a spot to prove my importance. You have
<br>taken me as who I am and always remember that you
<br>too, are loved and you deserve the same love that you
<br>are giving me. You deserve greater than that because

<br>I know we still have more to prepare our hearts and
<br>selves from knowing we're still in the starting line yet.
<br>There'll be more to ponder and more to doubt. There
<br>will be more reasons to hate the class or work schedules
<br>and why we barely have time together. But I hope
<br>despite being swallowed by the world's busy system, we
<br>won't allow it to destruct the plans that we are
<br>constructing inside our heads.<br>
<br>This time, I wish nothing but just more patience as we
<br>deal with things that are too unpredictable. I pray that
<br>both of us will be more matured to handle issues and
<br>consider understanding and sympathy first and
<br>foremost. I hope that we will never turn ourselves
<br>against each other because we're supposed to be the
<br>best support that will help us ease the troubles that we
<br>can't convert into verbal words. Both of us should be
<br>there for each other as we deal with all the things that
<br>come through our way. And if arguments are inevitable,
<br>I hope that we will be more focused on what it is trying
<br>to teach us instead of allowing it to expand the gap that
<br>comes in between our misunderstandings.<br>
<br>Every day we are learning.
<br>Every day, life gave me more reasons to love you.</p>

<br>I know that there are more to come, more complicated
<br>things to deal and argue with. We will be remembering
<br>those as new memories that we will always look up to
<br>strengthen us until we mastered how to bend so we
<br>won't break. I know that as the clock ticks, we will be
<br>more prone to more sensitive issues that will put our
<br>trust and respect on stake. We will have more things to
<br>conquer and more fights to argue with. We will have
<br>more storms to deal with, storms made up of collected
<br>blames and hatreds that will break our living room
<br>where both of us will refuse to clean on the same day of
<br>the encounter. We have more words to throw at each
<br>other's faces and more silences to ignore.<br>
<br>After all, those fights will come out of nowhere to tell
<br>us something and teach us how to remain strong. They
<br>will provide us a stronger foundation and sheer reasons
<br>why it was worth winning all the battles with. I
<br>appreciate you for your courage to dive in my pool of
<br>sadness and cuddle me like I was the best thing that
<br>ever happened to you. You will always be the warmth
<br>my skin wants to feel.<br>
<br>You are my calm after the storm, the only person who
<br>could give me the peace out from my self-made chaos.</p>
